schema: spec-driven

context: |
  This project follows Strict Spec-Driven Development (SDD).

  Specs define system behavior, not implementation.
  All behavior must be explicit, testable, and deterministic.

  Core principles:
  - No code without a spec
  - No tests without a spec
  - No tasks without tests
  - No implicit decisions
  - Specs describe WHAT the system does, never HOW
  - Tests are executable contracts derived from specs

  This repository is intentionally technology-agnostic.
  Do not assume frameworks, languages, databases, APIs, or architectures.

  The project enforces a strict development flow:
  PROPOSAL → SPECS → TEST_CONTRACT → TASKS → IMPLEMENTATION → ARCHIVE

rules:
  proposal:
    - Clearly state intent and scope
    - Explicitly list non-goals
    - Avoid solutioning or technical decisions
    - Use plain language understandable by non-engineers
    - MUST NOT reference implementation, architecture, or tools

  specs:
    - Use OpenSpec delta format only (ADDED / MODIFIED / REMOVED)
    - Each requirement must describe observable system behavior
    - Each requirement must include GIVEN / WHEN / THEN scenarios
    - Outcomes must be deterministic
    - Explicitly state what the system does NOT do
    - MUST NOT include:
        - APIs
        - endpoints
        - data models
        - schemas
        - algorithms
        - performance considerations
        - frameworks or libraries
    - If behavior is ambiguous, the process MUST stop and request clarification

  design:
    - Design is OPTIONAL and may only be created AFTER specs are approved
    - Design explains approach, not code
    - May introduce high-level technical concepts only
    - MUST NOT define:
        - functions
        - classes
        - modules
        - files
    - MUST remain consistent with approved specs
    - MUST NOT contradict test contracts
    - If design introduces new behavior, the process MUST stop

  tasks:
    - Tasks must be derived strictly from the test contract
    - One task = one verifiable capability
    - Tasks must reference test scenarios, not specs
    - Tasks must be atomic and behavior-focused
    - MUST NOT mention:
        - files
        - functions
        - classes
        - frameworks
        - libraries
    - If a task implies a design decision, the process MUST stop

  implementation:
    - Implementation exists only to satisfy tasks and tests
    - MUST NOT introduce new behavior
    - MUST NOT modify specs, tests, or tasks
    - MUST stop once tests pass
    - Any refactor not required by tests is forbidden

  archive:
    - Only archive changes when:
        - Specs are approved
        - Test contracts exist
        - Tasks are completed
        - Tests pass
    - Archived changes become part of the system’s source of truth
