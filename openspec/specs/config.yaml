schema: spec-driven

context: |
  This project follows Spec-Driven Development (SDD).

  Specs define system behavior, not implementation.
  All behavior must be explicit, testable, and deterministic.

  Core principles:
  - No code without a spec
  - No tests without a spec
  - No implicit decisions
  - Specs describe what the system does, never how it is implemented
  - Tests are contracts derived from specs, not examples

  This repository is intentionally technology-agnostic.
  Do not assume frameworks, languages, databases, APIs, or architectures.

rules:
  proposal:
    - Clearly state intent and scope
    - Explicitly list non-goals
    - Avoid solutioning or technical decisions
    - Use plain language understandable by non-engineers

  specs:
    - Use OpenSpec delta format only (ADDED / MODIFIED / REMOVED)
    - Each requirement must describe observable system behavior
    - Each requirement must include GIVEN / WHEN / THEN scenarios
    - Outcomes must be deterministic
    - Do not include implementation, data structures, APIs, or algorithms
    - Explicitly state what the system does NOT do

  design:
    - Design explains approach, not code
    - May introduce technical concepts, but no function or class definitions
    - Must stay consistent with approved specs
    - Must not contradict the test contract

  tasks:
    - Tasks must be derived strictly from the test contract
    - One task = one verifiable capability
    - Tasks must reference scenarios, not implementation details
    - Do not mention files, functions, classes, or frameworks
    - Tasks should be atomic and behavior-focused

  archive:
    - Only archive changes when:
      - Specs are approved
      - Test contracts exist
      - Tests pass
    - Archived changes become part of the system’s source of truth
